Learn more about us here (link).\n\nWHY JOIN US?\nEarly-stage, yet de-risked: we are a rare combo of being early stage (high upside) but lower risk (2XX+ paying customers, $Xm+ recurring revenue, cash-flow positive for over a year, hockey-stick growth). You get the benefits of an early stage startup without the risk you\u2019ll have at almost any other startup. You\u2019ll have a ton of impact, work directly with our customers, and get to work on interesting technical challenges you won\u2019t see at bigger companies. Although we\u2019re early stage, we\u2019ve eliminated key strategic risks you\u2019ll face at other startups. Like an unproven product, lack of market validation, lack of revenue, over-reliance on VC funding, co-founder disputes. We\u2019re all young and hungry. Our team is fully in-person, tenacious, and committed - most of us moved to SF from far away (Canada, SoCal, Texas, Virginia) specifically to build Agave from the ground up.\nTeam is technical, diverse, young: you'll work with a formidable founding team that's experienced, intense, and ambitious. We've worked together for 10 years, first at a startup that Amazon acquired, then at Amazon, and now at Agave. You'll learn a ton while having outsized ownership. You\u2019ll have a front-row seat to the good and bad of building a company from the ground up. We\u2019re also technical - all but 1 of our team (our AE!) have either majored in CS, worked as full-time devs, and/or worked in technical roles at startups and larger tech companies for 5+ years before moving into business roles at Agave.\nHuge opportunity without direct competition: startups are incredibly hard, so you want to join one that has a unique advantage. You don\u2019t want to spend years of your life on a company in a saturated market with tons of competition. We\u2019re seizing an opportunity that\u2019s massive (Construction is the world\u2019s third-largest industry) but also overlooked by most people in startup land. Most who can solve this problem aren\u2019t aware it exists or are too distracted by tech trends (blockchain, metaverse, LLMs, etc.) to notice. These talented folks get coaxed into building products that seem cool early on, but don\u2019t solve durable problems or aren\u2019t differentiated enough against their many competitors to be sustainable (e.g. lots of AI products), so they end-up not going anywhere or stagnating without a clear plan to grow profitably. As a result, we have a multi-year head start against potential competitors, increasing our odds of success significantly. We\u2019re also backed by world-class investors (Accel, YC) and Construction insiders (Procore and Autodesk executives, founders of the largest construction tech companies like PlanGrid).\nREQUIREMENTS\nBack-end/full-stack engineer, ideally with 1-4 years experience (we're open to exceptional college grads with strong intern/co-op experience).\nFamiliarity with cloud infrastructure (e.g. AWS).\nSelf-motivated, high ownership, low ego; desire to work on a fast-paced, intense, fun team. Excited to be our next hire; passion for building a world-class engineering culture.\nPumped to work in-person with us in SF 5 days/week.\nNo need to have: prior experience with our tech stack or at B2B SaaS/API company\nINTERESTING TECHNICAL CHALLENGES?\nUnification: we\u2019re unifying dozens-to-hundreds of fragmented systems under a single standard that we define. Our unification covers data objects, data models, authentication, account-linking UX, and features like filters and pagination. When designing any new feature, we have to do it in a scalable way. For example, when adding filters, we have to research each system we support (and plan to support) and create a generic, system-agnostic solution.\nOn-prem: we\u2019re connecting with many types of on-prem systems (SQL-based, DLL-based, API-based), many built 20-40 years ago. We provide tremendous value to customers allowing them to interface with these systems in a secure, fast, reliable way, as if they\u2019re modern, cloud-based products. We need to support real-time communication and webhooks when they don\u2019t exist (e.g., using web-sockets).\nScale & speed: we\u2019re handling millions of API requests per day, and growing daily. For our products that we power with our own API (e.g. Analytics), we need to store and retrieve large amounts of data in an efficient way, building elegant caching layers to reduce latency. We ship code daily and iterate quickly based on actual feedback from paying customers (they share tons!).\nOperational excellence: we\u2019re creating a reliable API layer on top of many old systems that don\u2019t have APIs. It\u2019s like building a skyscraper on quicksand, enforced by SLAs. We need to innovate in expanding the depth and breadth of our integrations while simultaneously increasing our development velocity. We need to be very creative in how to continually test our code and integrations, creating scalable testing frameworks that can catch edge cases and bugs across 1k+ endpoints.\nMix of back-end and front-end: we\u2019re building front-end apps that dog-food our own APIs (e.g. Sync, Analytics). This helps us build world-class APIs because we suffer any pain present in our API. We\u2019re building both the lego blocks and the higher-level lego models: we see what kinds of APIs our SaaS customers want, then also look at the kinds of API niceties we want for our own applications (like a caching layer, advanced filtering) and implement a combination of the two.\nVariety: without knowing, you might assume adding a new integration is low-ambiguity and routine. But each integration we launch is special, completely different and posing unique challenges. This requires researching that system and its nuances in great depth before building on top of it. It\u2019s part engineering, part archeology.\nTECH STACK?\nTypeScript, React, Redis, Postgres, AWS - CDK, EC2\nBENEFITS\nHealthcare: we cover 90% of your healthcare costs with several plan options.\n401k: we match 100% of your contributions, up to 4% of annual salary.\nRelocation: sizable relocation bonus for folks currently located outside of the Bay Area.\nGym: on-site gym with Peloton, squat rack, Tempo, Yoga setup, and more.\nVisa: we sponsor Visas (H1B, TN, etc.) for candidates who are a good fit!\nIN-PERSON\nWe've built Agave in-person since day 1, and will maintain an in-person culture in San Francisco going forward. We form tighter bonds, build a stronger culture, and move faster since we're all working from one location.\nOur office is at 101 New Montgomery Street, San Francisco, right near Salesforce Park, coffee shops & restaurants, and a bustling downtown. We believe building in-person is a huge strategic advantage, and we hope you\u2019ll join us.",

We are looking for someone to help us build out innovative new features, prepare our technology to scale, and help shape our engineering organization to be the kind of place that bright minds from across the region and the world aspire to work for.\n\nAs our team is small, our ideal candidate is a creative thinker excited to solve hard problems and to build something from the ground up. They can move quickly, clearly articulate tradeoffs, and have the judgement to own features independently. They are obsessive about delivering great, high quality products to our users. We are ambitious and excited to build big things, and we\u2019d love to bring on someone who is as well.

  "https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/porter/jobs/6QhplSz-full-stack-engineer": "Full Stack Engineer\n$100K - $200K\nLocation\nNew York City\nJob Type\nFull-time\nExperience\nAny (new grads ok)\nVisa\nWill sponsor\nConnect directly with founders of the best YC-funded\u00a0startups.\nApply to role \u203a\nJustin Rhee\nFounder<a href=\"https://github.com/porter-dev/porter\" target=\"_blank\">View the Porter GitHub repo</a>\n\nTHE ROLE:\n\nWe're looking for a full stack engineer who is fluent in React/Typescript but comfortable working across the entire stack. This includes building on top of our Go backend as well as working directly with the Kubernetes and Helm APIs. Since Porter is a PaaS that abstracts the complexity of Kubernetes, deeply considered design/architectural decisions are the lifeblood of our platform. The best implementation is not always the most obvious one, so an appetite for rigorously evaluating the tradeoffs of different options is essential.\n\nYou will be expected to push critical code on a daily basis while also working on larger features that constantly expand the capabilities of the platform.\n\nYOU WILL:\nBuild and maintain new features on the Porter dashboard\nDevelop our Go API to accommodate additional k8s/Helm behaviors\nCreate applets and add-ons for popular technologies like MySQL, Redis, Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.\nImprove the UI and organization of the dashboard (strong UI/UX background is a nice to have)\nRaise the standard for code quality and our engineering culture\nWHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR:\n\nWe value rate of learning above all else. Full stack experience and fluency with React/TypeScript is expected, but less familiarity with Go/Kubernetes is fine if you're a voracious and self-directed learner. Infrastructure management isn't rocket science, but it does involve thinking and working across multiple levels of abstraction at once. If the idea of wrangling that complexity is exciting and not daunting to you, we'd love to talk. As is the case with most early-stage startups, you should be comfortable with regularly shifting priorities and iterating at a very high (daily) velocity.\n\nSOME OF THE TECHNICAL CHALLENGES WE FACE:\nAbstracting Kubernetes - any PaaS spans a variety of use cases, so building a consistent and useful layer of abstraction requires constant awareness of the needs of many user profiles.\nAuto-Generated Frontend - each of our app/add-on templates uses a form.yaml file that programmatically generates a settings UI on the dashboard using a library of our own input primitives. Expanding and testing the functionality of these templates is non-trivial.\nCloud Agnosticism - one of Porter's main benefits is that you get the same interface for managing services regardless of where you host. Our job is to reduce multi-cloud infrastructure complexity to a unified interface.\nMany Integrations - our philosophy is to never reinvent the wheel, so we leverage tools like GitHub Actions, existing container registries, and the APIs of various cloud providers. An issue with any one of these integrations interrupts functionality, so properly handling interactions with numerous services is crucial.\nSAMPLE PROJECTS YOU MIGHT WORK ON:\nBuild a dashboard that gives an infra-level overview of machines being managed by Porter and their current resource utilization\nImplement live email/Slack alerts for successful or failed deployments\nDevelop a deployment pipeline builder that lets users seamlessly promote services across multiple clusters and environments (ex: dev -> staging -> prod)\nCreate one-click deployable applets for popular technologies (e.g. RabbitMQ, Kafka, Cassandra, etc.)\nTECH STACK:\nWeb: React (styled-components), TypeScript\nBackend: Go, Kubernetes + Helm APIs, Postgres, Redis\nInfrastructure: AWS, GCP\n\nPorter is open source. You can view our entire codebase here: https://github.com/porter-dev/porter.\n\nWe are a fully in-person team located in NYC, and we require that you come into the office everyday.\n\nInterested?
