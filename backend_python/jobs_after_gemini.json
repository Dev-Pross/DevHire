Drops have become the predominant marketing strategy for merch, tickets and content and we're building the leading CRM to power them. The platform combines landing pages, messaging, link tracking, and more to empower musicians, artists, celebrities, creators and brands with the tools to drive more sales and streams around their most important moments.\n\nAs a full stack engineer, writing code and building beautiful user experiences is just one part of your job. You'll also talk to users, get involved with design, and develop your own opinion on what needs to exist in the world. Then you'll move with urgency to make it happen.\n\nLaylo now powers Drops to over 30 million fans across music, sports and live events. Notable customers include Sabrina Carpenter, Usher, The Milwaukee Bucks, NASCAR, and Rolling Loud.\n\nTo learn more about how we work, take a look at Our Values\n\nWHAT WILL YOU DO?\nYou'll work with a small engineering team to build mission-critical tools for creators.\nAs one of our first engineers, you'll build entirely new products from scratch and make important architectural decisions.\nYou'll be responsible for planning, organizing, and executing entire projects end to end, from idea to launch. To do so, you'll have to work closely with design, operations, and (of course) creators.\nYou'll help build the foundation for Laylo engineering standards, tooling, and processes.\nCreators are the most visual people on the planet -- you'll build a user experience that is both visually stunning and easy-to-use.\nAs we grow, we'll build up an engineering team around you.\nREQUIREMENTS:\nExperience with: React, Node.js, Typescript, GraphQL, AWS Services (EC2, S3, Lambda)\nWE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO:\nCares about culture and wants to build something meaningful. The tools we create will empower the next generation of entrepreneurs, and we take that responsibility seriously.\nEnjoys all aspects of building a product from scratch. You love talking to customers just as much as making technical decisions.\nUnderstands the importance of both speed and quality, and the trade-offs of choosing one over the other.\nHas 3+ years experience with frontend development, preferably with hands-on experience with React, Typescript, and Graphql\nWants to join a tight-knit team -- we work on solutions as a whole engineering team. If you love working on the end-to-end product experience, you'll love working here.\nOTHER ROLES:\n\nIf this role isn\u2019t a fit for you but you\u2019d like to work with us, find all of our open roles here.\n\nABOUT US:\n\nOur founders met while building competing consumer startups. We\u2019ve launched multiple products across consumer and SaaS and talked to thousands of fans and creators in the process. In 2020, we realized one of the biggest pain points creators and brands have is building high conversion drop experiences and engaging with their fans.\n\nWe went through Y Combinator in summer 2020 while building that new product and after seeing really strong early traction, raised our seed round in mid 2021.\n\nRight now we're a small team that's mostly based in Los Angeles but working from remotely with other team members in various states. We're open to hiring remotely (in North America), but expect to find an office in Los Angeles at some point TBD.\n\nWe have a strong written documentation culture, leveraging Notion to share ideas and record processes and learnings. We try to do as much as possible asynchronously to move quickly and efficiently. We have a daily 30 minute standup and operate across Slack, Notion & Figma.",

This role is fully remote, but we do prefer candidates in US timezones so everyone has some overlapping work hours. As an early employee, you will have immense impact on the product and business.\n\nSOME OF THE PROBLEMS YOU\u2019LL BE WORKING ON\nScaling Event Ingestion. We ingest analytics events from customers (e.g. button clicks, purchases) and make them available for querying with SQL. We need to scale to millions of events per second while keeping latency low (<30s).\nWarehouse Native Product Analytics. We are building an analytics suite (a la Mixpanel or Amplitude) on top of a company\u2019s existing SQL data warehouse. This will require extensive front-end work, data engineering, and performance tuning.\nRealtime Feature Flag Analytics. When a developer pushes code live, they want to know two things right away - \u201cDid I just break anything?\u201d and \u201cIs anyone using my new feature?\u201d. APM tools like DataDog only get you part of the way there and we want to build a truly comprehensive solution.\nRobust SQL Test Suite. We support 12 different SQL data sources, from Postgres to BigQuery to PrestoDB, and each of them have their own quirks and bugs that we need to work around. Supporting this at scale will require building robust automated test suites and provisioning complex cloud infrastructure on demand.\nStreaming Features Service. When someone toggles a feature flag in GrowthBook, we want it to propagate to all of their clients around the world within seconds. And we need to do this reliably (99.999% uptime) and at scale (billions of requests per day).\nREQUIREMENTS\nExpert in Typescript, React, and Node.js\nSolid understanding of both SQL and NoSQL databases\nExperience building large web applications from scratch\nFluent English and good communication skills\nStartup experience or interest working in a small company\nBonus: Contributed to an open-source project\nBonus: Used feature flags or A/B testing at a previous company\nBonus: Built data-heavy analytics applications\nBENEFITS\n100% remote work from anywhere (within US time zones)\nHealth, Vision, and Dental benefits (we cover 100% of the cost for employees and 95% for dependents)\nGenerous tech stipend for your home office (or coworking space)\nRegular off-sites in exciting places (our latest one was in the Dominican Republic)\n\nGrowthBook is an equal opportunity employer, and is committed to creating an inclusive, supportive environment for all employees.\n\nWe regret that we cannot sponsor employment visas at this time, although we can make exceptions for H1B transfers.",

You'll play a vital role in how we foster an inspiring culture, and in how we scale the organization in the coming years.\n\nYou love solving problems, right? That's why you're here. Well, we've got excited customers, eagerly awaiting your ideas and implementations. We've got tons of interesting challenges ahead \u2013 both technical and non-technical \u2013 and we definitely don't have all the answers yet, but we're striving to ask better questions every day.\n\nDo you relish in the delight of customers, and in the opportunity to develop an amazing product you'll be proud of, and one they'll be happy to pay for?

On the frontend, we have a NextJS application using TypeScript.\n\nWe don't expect you to be an expert in every one of those areas.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf you've enjoyed working in any functional language, we think you'll love Elixir (but if you've never even dabbled, we think you'll love it too). If you've felt productive working with a framework like Rails or Django, you'll get the hang of Phoenix in no time.\n\nIf you've worked with React, but not TypeScript, we can work with that. If you know your JS, but have never written React, that's fine too. You get the picture \u2013 it's not about your familiarity with specific technologies. If you're an expert in one or another domain, but open to learning as you go, we'll start from there.\n\nOver time, we'll expect you to wear many hats. You'll be an architect balancing performance and pragmatism. You'll be a developer considering and implementing different designs. You'll be a product manager cutting and simplifying features. You'll be a leader and a mentor.\n\nYou're the kind of developer who knows not only what the best practices are, but understands why they are, and so knows when to ignore them. You're confident in making your case but open to alternative ideas, and willing to disagree and commit either way.\n\nPERKS AND BENEFITS:\n\nCompetitive base salary and equity\n\nHealth insurance\n\nPension plan\n\nAll the latest tech you need; MacBooks, monitors, etc.\n\nMonthly budget to spend on books and conferences to keep learning\n\n28 days paid vacation\n\nHOW DOES THE INTERVIEW PROCESS LOOK LIKE?\n\nIntro call\n\nTechnical Assessment\n\nTechnical interview\n\nCareer History Interview\n\nFounder's Interview",

This includes building on top of our Go backend as well as working directly with the Kubernetes and Helm APIs. Since Porter is a PaaS that abstracts the complexity of Kubernetes, deeply considered design/architectural decisions are the lifeblood of our platform. The best implementation is not always the most obvious one, so an appetite for rigorously evaluating the tradeoffs of different options is essential.\n\nYou will be expected to push critical code on a daily basis while also working on larger features that constantly expand the capabilities of the platform.\n\nYOU WILL:\nBuild and maintain new features on the Porter dashboard\nDevelop our Go API to accommodate additional k8s/Helm behaviors\nCreate applets and add-ons for popular technologies like MySQL, Redis, Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.\nImprove the UI and organization of the dashboard (strong UI/UX background is a nice to have)\nRaise the standard for code quality and our engineering culture\nWHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR:\n\nWe value rate of learning above all else. Full stack experience and fluency with React/TypeScript is expected, but less familiarity with Go/Kubernetes is fine if you're a voracious and self-directed learner. Infrastructure management isn't rocket science, but it does involve thinking and working across multiple levels of abstraction at once. If the idea of wrangling that complexity is exciting and not daunting to you, we'd love to talk. As is the case with most early-stage startups, you should be comfortable with regularly shifting priorities and iterating at a very high (daily) velocity.\n\nSOME OF THE TECHNICAL CHALLENGES WE FACE:\nAbstracting Kubernetes - any PaaS spans a variety of use cases, so building a consistent and useful layer of abstraction requires constant awareness of the needs of many user profiles.\nAuto-Generated Frontend - each of our app/add-on templates uses a form.yaml file that programmatically generates a settings UI on the dashboard using a library of our own input primitives. Expanding and testing the functionality of these templates is non-trivial.\nCloud Agnosticism - one of Porter's main benefits is that you get the same interface for managing services regardless of where you host. Our job is to reduce multi-cloud infrastructure complexity to a unified interface.\nMany Integrations - our philosophy is to never reinvent the wheel, so we leverage tools like GitHub Actions, existing container registries, and the APIs of various cloud providers. An issue with any one of these integrations interrupts functionality, so properly handling interactions with numerous services is crucial.\nSAMPLE PROJECTS YOU MIGHT WORK ON:\nBuild a dashboard that gives an infra-level overview of machines being managed by Porter and their current resource utilization\nImplement live email/Slack alerts for successful or failed deployments\nDevelop a deployment pipeline builder that lets users seamlessly promote services across multiple clusters and environments (ex: dev -> staging -> prod)\nCreate one-click deployable applets for popular technologies (e.g. RabbitMQ, Kafka, Cassandra, etc.)\nTECH STACK:\nWeb: React (styled-components), TypeScript\nBackend: Go, Kubernetes + Helm APIs, Postgres, Redis\nInfrastructure: AWS, GCP\n\nPorter is open source. You can view our entire codebase here: https://github.com/porter-dev/porter.\n\nWe are a fully in-person team located in NYC, and we require that you come into the office everyday.\n\nInterested?

We build tools to help run YC, as well as to help our founders have an unfair advantage \u2014 through our unparalleled founder network, expert advice from YC General Partners, exclusive funding opportunities, and much more.\n\nWorking at YC is a unique place to operating like a startup \u2014 talking to customers and shipping code rapidly \u2014 and also be surrounded and learning at the frontier of the new startup world.\n\nAbout the role\n\nWhile the software team itself is very small (~15 people), the impact of our software for our founders and for YC itself is quite massive. Some examples of the software you\u2019d get to work on:\n\nYC\u2019s application software. Every batch, we review over 20K applicants, manage interviews with thousands of founders, and select just over 100 companies \u2014 all within 3 weeks. To accomplish this feat, we write serious power tools to help partners like Garry and Harj manage the process and make decisions, and we\u2019re constantly working to make the software better.\nFounder fundraising software. We\u2019ve built the most critical tools for founders to raise a successful seed round: a leads pipeline from Demo Day, legal tools to execute YC safes, and an all-in-one CRM to manage investor relations. Founders regularly tell us that this is the best part of YC.\nInvestment software. YC manages over $6B in our fund, and we write software to help us manage it end-to-end: how to invest it, know where it\u2019s allocated, and even use AI to keep our records up-to-date with what founders need from us.\nHiring platform. We\u2019ve built a job marketplace with over 2M job seekers for founders to engage, as well a full suite of messaging and AI-assisted recruiting tools to help founders find great people and hire faster.\n\nAnd despite all of this, we still feel like we\u2019re just getting started. We have a lot of great ideas on every front to improve how YC operates and to bring tremendous value to our startups, and many of them are \ud83e\udd2b.\n\nAbout the team\n\nAs a company, we largely abide by the same principles we teach our startups - so if you've read Paul Graham's essays or watched our videos on YouTube, you can already predict what it would be like to work here.\n\nMany of our software teammates have worked at or started startups themselves, while also having experience from bigger companies like Meta and Google. This tends to be a good balance to know how to ship quickly, but also make strong product and technical decisions that don\u2019t leave us with dead ends. True to YC advice, our product engineers talk to our customers regularly and ship fast. We also define our own roadmap and often design our own products when needed.\n\nOur stack is pretty straightforward (Rails, React, Postgres), and the last three engineers have learned it on the job. That said, we\u2019ve found that enjoying front-end software development is key to being successful here, so it\u2019s almost a requirement for the role. Our needs as an organization require a large degree of flexibility, and people change teams quite often.\n\nMore and more, our founders are introducing AI in all they do \u2014 how they code, how their product works, and how they streamline their own operations. At YC, we\u2019re similarly pushing the boundaries of how AI can improve our software and help our companies. We\u2019re excited to share more in person \u2014 so please take a moment to apply. ;-)\n\nLastly: If you\u2019re interested in starting your own startup one day: eight former engineers on our team have gone on to start YC-funded startups.\u00a0 If you want to start your own startup someday but aren\u2019t ready to do it now, working at YC could be an excellent way to get there, provided you\u2019re willing to be here for at least 2-3 years.\n\nLocation: This is an in-person role at YC's campus in Dogpatch, San Francisco. This is where our users (founders, partners, and employees) are five days a week, so it\u2019s optimal for you to be here with them. You must live in the SF Bay Area or be willing to relocate.\u00a0 We offer generous relocation support for those who want to move to SF to work here.\n\nCompensation: $180,000 to $270,000 base (depending on skills and experience) plus bonus.\n\nBenefits : YC has a profit-sharing program, which is comparable to equity in an early-stage\u00a0startup or carry in a VC fund.\n\nOur full benefits package includes medical, vision, and dental plans, infertility benefit, STD/LTD, life insurance, commuter benefits, flexible spending account, health savings account, 401(k) + 4% matching, generous parental leave, paid holidays, and flexible paid time off policy.\n\nWork Authorization: This position does not support work authorization/visa sponsorship.\n\nLegal note: Y Combinator considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state, and local law, including San Francisco\u2019s Fair Chance Ordinance. Y Combinator is committed to protecting the privacy of the personal information of job applicants and complying with the California Consumer Privacy Act.

    "job_description": "Software Engineer\n$130K - $240K / 0.05% - 0.20%\nLocation\nSan Francisco, CA\nJob Type\nFull-time\nExperience\n1+ years\nVisa\nWill sponsor\nConnect directly with founders of the best YC-funded\u00a0startups.\nApply to role \u203a\nTom Reno\nCo-foundertl;dr: we're looking for a world-class full-stack/backend engineer who loves simplifying complex systems, unifying fragmented data, and building high-scale systems. Learn more about us here (link).\n\nWHY JOIN US?\nEarly-stage, yet de-risked: we are a rare combo of being early stage (high upside) but lower risk (2XX+ paying customers, $Xm+ recurring revenue, cash-flow positive for over a year, hockey-stick growth). You get the benefits of an early stage startup without the risk you\u2019ll have at almost any other startup. You\u2019ll have a ton of impact, work directly with our customers, and get to work on interesting technical challenges you won\u2019t see at bigger companies. Although we\u2019re early stage, we\u2019ve eliminated key strategic risks you\u2019ll face at other startups. Like an unproven product, lack of market validation, lack of revenue, over-reliance on VC funding, co-founder disputes. We\u2019re all young and hungry. Our team is fully in-person, tenacious, and committed - most of us moved to SF from far away (Canada, SoCal, Texas, Virginia) specifically to build Agave from the ground up.\nTeam is technical, diverse, young: you'll work with a formidable founding team that's experienced, intense, and ambitious. We've worked together for 10 years, first at a startup that Amazon acquired, then at Amazon, and now at Agave. You'll learn a ton while having outsized ownership. You\u2019ll have a front-row seat to the good and bad of building a company from the ground up. We\u2019re also technical - all but 1 of our team (our AE!) have either majored in CS, worked as full-time devs, and/or worked in technical roles at startups and larger tech companies for 5+ years before moving into business roles at Agave.\nHuge opportunity without direct competition: startups are incredibly hard, so you want to join one that has a unique advantage. You don\u2019t want to spend years of your life on a company in a saturated market with tons of competition. We\u2019re seizing an opportunity that\u2019s massive (Construction is the world\u2019s third-largest industry) but also overlooked by most people in startup land. Most who can solve this problem aren\u2019t aware it exists or are too distracted by tech trends (blockchain, metaverse, LLMs, etc.) to notice. These talented folks get coaxed into building products that seem cool early on, but don\u2019t solve durable problems or aren\u2019t differentiated enough against their many competitors to be sustainable (e.g. lots of AI products), so they end-up not going anywhere or stagnating without a clear plan to grow profitably. As a result, we have a multi-year head start against potential competitors, increasing our odds of success significantly. We\u2019re also backed by world-class investors (Accel, YC) and Construction insiders (Procore and Autodesk executives, founders of the largest construction tech companies like PlanGrid).\nREQUIREMENTS\nBack-end/full-stack engineer, ideally with 1-4 years experience (we're open to exceptional college grads with strong intern/co-op experience).\nFamiliarity with cloud infrastructure (e.g. AWS).\nSelf-motivated, high ownership, low ego; desire to work on a fast-paced, intense, fun team. Excited to be our next hire; passion for building a world-class engineering culture.\nPumped to work in-person with us in SF 5 days/week.\nNo need to have: prior experience with our tech stack or at B2B SaaS/API company\nINTERESTING TECHNICAL CHALLENGES?\nUnification: we\u2019re unifying dozens-to-hundreds of fragmented systems under a single standard that we define. Our unification covers data objects, data models, authentication, account-linking UX, and features like filters and pagination. When designing any new feature, we have to do it in a scalable way. For example, when adding filters, we have to research each system we support (and plan to support) and create a generic, system-agnostic solution.\nOn-prem: we\u2019re connecting with many types of on-prem systems (SQL-based, DLL-based, API-based), many built 20-40 years ago. We provide tremendous value to customers allowing them to interface with these systems in a secure, fast, reliable way, as if they\u2019re modern, cloud-based products. We need to support real-time communication and webhooks when they don\u2019t exist (e.g., using web-sockets).\nScale & speed: we\u2019re handling millions of API requests per day, and growing daily. For our products that we power with our own API (e.g. Analytics), we need to store and retrieve large amounts of data in an efficient way, building elegant caching layers to reduce latency. We ship code daily and iterate quickly based on actual feedback from paying customers (they share tons!).\nOperational excellence: we\u2019re creating a reliable API layer on top of many old systems that don\u2019t have APIs. It\u2019s like building a skyscraper on quicksand, enforced by SLAs. We need to innovate in expanding the depth and breadth of our integrations while simultaneously increasing our development velocity. We need to be very creative in how to continually test our code and integrations, creating scalable testing frameworks that can catch edge cases and bugs across 1k+ endpoints.\nMix of back-end and front-end: we\u2019re building front-end apps that dog-food our own APIs (e.g. Sync, Analytics). This helps us build world-class APIs because we suffer any pain present in our API. We\u2019re building both the lego blocks and the higher-level lego models: we see what kinds of APIs our SaaS customers want, then also look at the kinds of API niceties we want for our own applications (like a caching layer, advanced filtering) and implement a combination of the two.\nVariety: without knowing, you might assume adding a new integration is low-ambiguity and routine. But each integration we launch is special, completely different and posing unique challenges. This requires researching that system and its nuances in great depth before building on top of it. It\u2019s part engineering, part archeology.\nTECH STACK?\nTypeScript, React, Redis, Postgres, AWS - CDK, EC2\nBENEFITS\nHealthcare: we cover 90% of your healthcare costs with several plan options.\n401k: we match 100% of your contributions, up to 4% of annual salary.\nRelocation: sizable relocation bonus for folks currently located outside of the Bay Area.\nGym: on-site gym with Peloton, squat rack, Tempo, Yoga setup, and more.\nVisa: we sponsor Visas (H1B, TN, etc.) for candidates who are a good fit!\nIN-PERSON\nWe've built Agave in-person since day 1, and will maintain an in-person culture in San Francisco going forward. We form tighter bonds, build a stronger culture, and move faster since we're all working from one location.\nOur office is at 101 New Montgomery Street, San Francisco, right near Salesforce Park, coffee shops & restaurants, and a bustling downtown. We believe building in-person is a huge strategic advantage, and we hope you\u2019ll join us.",
