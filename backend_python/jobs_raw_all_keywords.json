  "https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/y-combinator/jobs/rq3DaTs-product-engineer": "[MATCHED_ROLES: backend-developer]\n\nProduct Engineer\n$180K - $270K\nLocation\nSan Francisco, CA, US\nJob Type\nFull-time\nExperience\n3+ years\nVisa\nUS citizen/visa only\nApply to Y Combinator and hundreds of other fast-growing YC startups with a single profile.\nApply to role ›\n\nY Combinator is run by a small team that is committed to helping founders build their startup and make it take off like the next Airbnb, Stripe, Reddit or Doordash (all companies that previously went through YC).\n\nWhile YC is primarily known for it’s batch program for founders, what’s lesser known is that we have our own small-but-mighty software team. We build tools to help run YC, as well as to help our founders have an unfair advantage — through our unparalleled founder network, expert advice from YC General Partners, exclusive funding opportunities, and much more.\n\nWorking at YC is a unique place to operating like a startup — talking to customers and shipping code rapidly — and also be surrounded and learning at the frontier of the new startup world.\n\nAbout the role\n\nWhile the software team itself is very small (~15 people), the impact of our software for our founders and for YC itself is quite massive. Some examples of the software you’d get to work on:\n\nYC’s application software. Every batch, we review over 20K applicants, manage interviews with thousands of founders, and select just over 100 companies — all within 3 weeks. To accomplish this feat, we write serious power tools to help partners like Garry and Harj manage the process and make decisions, and we’re constantly working to make the software better.\nFounder fundraising software. We’ve built the most critical tools for founders to raise a successful seed round: a leads pipeline from Demo Day, legal tools to execute YC safes, and an all-in-one CRM to manage investor relations. Founders regularly tell us that this is the best part of YC.\nInvestment software. YC manages over $6B in our fund, and we write software to help us manage it end-to-end: how to invest it, know where it’s allocated, and even use AI to keep our records up-to-date with what founders need from us.\nHiring platform. We’ve built a job marketplace with over 2M job seekers for founders to engage, as well a full suite of messaging and AI-assisted recruiting tools to help founders find great people and hire faster.\n\nAnd despite all of this, we still feel like we’re just getting started. We have a lot of great ideas on every front to improve how YC operates and to bring tremendous value to our startups, and many of them are 🤫.\n\nAbout the team\n\nAs a company, we largely abide by the same principles we teach our startups - so if you've read Paul Graham's essays or watched our videos on YouTube, you can already predict what it would be like to work here.\n\nMany of our software teammates have worked at or started startups themselves, while also having experience from bigger companies like Meta and Google. This tends to be a good balance to know how to ship quickly, but also make strong product and technical decisions that don’t leave us with dead ends. True to YC advice, our product engineers talk to our customers regularly and ship fast. We also define our own roadmap and often design our own products when needed.\n\nOur stack is pretty straightforward (Rails, React, Postgres), and the last three engineers have learned it on the job. That said, we’ve found that enjoying front-end software development is key to being successful here, so it’s almost a requirement for the role. Our needs as an organization require a large degree of flexibility, and people change teams quite often.\n\nMore and more, our founders are introducing AI in all they do — how they code, how their product works, and how they streamline their own operations. At YC, we’re similarly pushing the boundaries of how AI can improve our software and help our companies. We’re excited to share more in person — so please take a moment to apply. ;-)\n\nLastly: If you’re interested in starting your own startup one day: eight former engineers on our team have gone on to start YC-funded startups.  If you want to start your own startup someday but aren’t ready to do it now, working at YC could be an excellent way to get there, provided you’re willing to be here for at least 2-3 years.\n\nLocation: This is an in-person role at YC's campus in Dogpatch, San Francisco. This is where our users (founders, partners, and employees) are five days a week, so it’s optimal for you to be here with them. You must live in the SF Bay Area or be willing to relocate.  We offer generous relocation support for those who want to move to SF to work here.\n\nCompensation: $180,000 to $270,000 base (depending on skills and experience) plus bonus.\n\nBenefits : YC has a profit-sharing program, which is comparable to equity in an early-stage startup or carry in a VC fund.\n\nOur full benefits package includes medical, vision, and dental plans, infertility benefit, STD/LTD, life insurance, commuter benefits, flexible spending account, health savings account, 401(k) + 4% matching, generous parental leave, paid holidays, and flexible paid time off policy.\n\nWork Authorization: This position does not support work authorization/visa sponsorship.\n\nLegal note: Y Combinator considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state, and local law, including San Francisco’s Fair Chance Ordinance. Y Combinator is committed to protecting the privacy of the personal information of job applicants and complying with the California Consumer Privacy Act. The privacy policy of Ashby, Inc., the hiring platform used by Y Combinator, governs the collection of such data and can be found here.",

This role is fully remote, but we do prefer candidates in US timezones so everyone has some overlapping work hours. As an early employee, you will have immense impact on the product and business.\n\nSOME OF THE PROBLEMS YOU’LL BE WORKING ON\nScaling Event Ingestion. We ingest analytics events from customers (e.g. button clicks, purchases) and make them available for querying with SQL. We need to scale to millions of events per second while keeping latency low (<30s).\nWarehouse Native Product Analytics. We are building an analytics suite (a la Mixpanel or Amplitude) on top of a company’s existing SQL data warehouse. This will require extensive front-end work, data engineering, and performance tuning.\nRealtime Feature Flag Analytics. When a developer pushes code live, they want to know two things right away - “Did I just break anything?” and “Is anyone using my new feature?”. APM tools like DataDog only get you part of the way there and we want to build a truly comprehensive solution.\nRobust SQL Test Suite. We support 12 different SQL data sources, from Postgres to BigQuery to PrestoDB, and each of them have their own quirks and bugs that we need to work around. Supporting this at scale will require building robust automated test suites and provisioning complex cloud infrastructure on demand.\nStreaming Features Service.
