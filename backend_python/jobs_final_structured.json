Learn more about us here (link).\n\nWHY JOIN US?\nEarly-stage, yet de-risked: we are a rare combo of being early stage (high upside) but lower risk (2XX+ paying customers, $Xm+ recurring revenue, cash-flow positive for over a year, hockey-stick growth). You get the benefits of an early stage startup without the risk you‚Äôll have at almost any other startup. You‚Äôll have a ton of impact, work directly with our customers, and get to work on interesting technical challenges you won‚Äôt see at bigger companies. Although we‚Äôre early stage, we‚Äôve eliminated key strategic risks you‚Äôll face at other startups. Like an unproven product, lack of market validation, lack of revenue, over-reliance on VC funding, co-founder disputes. We‚Äôre all young and hungry. Our team is fully in-person, tenacious, and committed - most of us moved to SF from far away (Canada, SoCal, Texas, Virginia) specifically to build Agave from the ground up.\nTeam is technical, diverse, young: you'll work with a formidable founding team that's experienced, intense, and ambitious. We've worked together for 10 years, first at a startup that Amazon acquired, then at Amazon, and now at Agave. You'll learn a ton while having outsized ownership. You‚Äôll have a front-row seat to the good and bad of building a company from the ground up. We‚Äôre also technical - all but 1 of our team (our AE!) have either majored in CS, worked as full-time devs, and/or worked in technical roles at startups and larger tech companies for 5+ years before moving into business roles at Agave.\nHuge opportunity without direct competition: startups are incredibly hard, so you want to join one that has a unique advantage. You don‚Äôt want to spend years of your life on a company in a saturated market with tons of competition. We‚Äôre seizing an opportunity that‚Äôs massive (Construction is the world‚Äôs third-largest industry) but also overlooked by most people in startup land. Most who can solve this problem aren‚Äôt aware it exists or are too distracted by tech trends (blockchain, metaverse, LLMs, etc.) to notice. These talented folks get coaxed into building products that seem cool early on, but don‚Äôt solve durable problems or aren‚Äôt differentiated enough against their many competitors to be sustainable (e.g. lots of AI products), so they end-up not going anywhere or stagnating without a clear plan to grow profitably. As a result, we have a multi-year head start against potential competitors, increasing our odds of success significantly. We‚Äôre also backed by world-class investors (Accel, YC) and Construction insiders (Procore and Autodesk executives, founders of the largest construction tech companies like PlanGrid).\nREQUIREMENTS\nBack-end/full-stack engineer, ideally with 1-4 years experience (we're open to exceptional college grads with strong intern/co-op experience).\nFamiliarity with cloud infrastructure (e.g. AWS).\nSelf-motivated, high ownership, low ego; desire to work on a fast-paced, intense, fun team. Excited to be our next hire; passion for building a world-class engineering culture.\nPumped to work in-person with us in SF 5 days/week.\nNo need to have: prior experience with our tech stack or at B2B SaaS/API company\nINTERESTING TECHNICAL CHALLENGES?\nUnification: we‚Äôre unifying dozens-to-hundreds of fragmented systems under a single standard that we define. Our unification covers data objects, data models, authentication, account-linking UX, and features like filters and pagination. When designing any new feature, we have to do it in a scalable way. For example, when adding filters, we have to research each system we support (and plan to support) and create a generic, system-agnostic solution.\nOn-prem: we‚Äôre connecting with many types of on-prem systems (SQL-based, DLL-based, API-based), many built 20-40 years ago. We provide tremendous value to customers allowing them to interface with these systems in a secure, fast, reliable way, as if they‚Äôre modern, cloud-based products. We need to support real-time communication and webhooks when they don‚Äôt exist (e.g., using web-sockets).\nScale & speed: we‚Äôre handling millions of API requests per day, and growing daily. For our products that we power with our own API (e.g. Analytics), we need to store and retrieve large amounts of data in an efficient way, building elegant caching layers to reduce latency. We ship code daily and iterate quickly based on actual feedback from paying customers (they share tons!).\nOperational excellence: we‚Äôre creating a reliable API layer on top of many old systems that don‚Äôt have APIs. It‚Äôs like building a skyscraper on quicksand, enforced by SLAs. We need to innovate in expanding the depth and breadth of our integrations while simultaneously increasing our development velocity. We need to be very creative in how to continually test our code and integrations, creating scalable testing frameworks that can catch edge cases and bugs across 1k+ endpoints.\nMix of back-end and front-end: we‚Äôre building front-end apps that dog-food our own APIs (e.g. Sync, Analytics). This helps us build world-class APIs because we suffer any pain present in our API. We‚Äôre building both the lego blocks and the higher-level lego models: we see what kinds of APIs our SaaS customers want, then also look at the kinds of API niceties we want for our own applications (like a caching layer, advanced filtering) and implement a combination of the two.\nVariety: without knowing, you might assume adding a new integration is low-ambiguity and routine. But each integration we launch is special, completely different and posing unique challenges. This requires researching that system and its nuances in great depth before building on top of it. It‚Äôs part engineering, part archeology.\nTECH STACK?\nTypeScript, React, Redis, Postgres, AWS - CDK, EC2\nBENEFITS\nHealthcare: we cover 90% of your healthcare costs with several plan options.\n401k: we match 100% of your contributions, up to 4% of annual salary.\nRelocation: sizable relocation bonus for folks currently located outside of the Bay Area.\nGym: on-site gym with Peloton, squat rack, Tempo, Yoga setup, and more.\nVisa: we sponsor Visas (H1B, TN, etc.) for candidates who are a good fit!\nIN-PERSON\nWe've built Agave in-person since day 1, and will maintain an in-person culture in San Francisco going forward. We form tighter bonds, build a stronger culture, and move faster since we're all working from one location.\nOur office is at 101 New Montgomery Street, San Francisco, right near Salesforce Park, coffee shops & restaurants, and a bustling downtown. We believe building in-person is a huge strategic advantage, and we hope you‚Äôll join us.",

We build tools to help run YC, as well as to help our founders have an unfair advantage ‚Äî through our unparalleled founder network, expert advice from YC General Partners, exclusive funding opportunities, and much more.\n\nWorking at YC is a unique place to operating like a startup ‚Äî talking to customers and shipping code rapidly ‚Äî and also be surrounded and learning at the frontier of the new startup world.\n\nAbout the role\n\nWhile the software team itself is very small (~15 people), the impact of our software for our founders and for YC itself is quite massive. Some examples of the software you‚Äôd get to work on:\n\nYC‚Äôs application software. Every batch, we review over 20K applicants, manage interviews with thousands of founders, and select just over 100 companies ‚Äî all within 3 weeks. To accomplish this feat, we write serious power tools to help partners like Garry and Harj manage the process and make decisions, and we‚Äôre constantly working to make the software better.\nFounder fundraising software. We‚Äôve built the most critical tools for founders to raise a successful seed round: a leads pipeline from Demo Day, legal tools to execute YC safes, and an all-in-one CRM to manage investor relations. Founders regularly tell us that this is the best part of YC.\nInvestment software. YC manages over $6B in our fund, and we write software to help us manage it end-to-end: how to invest it, know where it‚Äôs allocated, and even use AI to keep our records up-to-date with what founders need from us.\nHiring platform. We‚Äôve built a job marketplace with over 2M job seekers for founders to engage, as well a full suite of messaging and AI-assisted recruiting tools to help founders find great people and hire faster.\n\nAnd despite all of this, we still feel like we‚Äôre just getting started. We have a lot of great ideas on every front to improve how YC operates and to bring tremendous value to our startups, and many of them are ü§´.\n\nAbout the team\n\nAs a company, we largely abide by the same principles we teach our startups - so if you've read Paul Graham's essays or watched our videos on YouTube, you can already predict what it would be like to work here.\n\nMany of our software teammates have worked at or started startups themselves, while also having experience from bigger companies like Meta and Google. This tends to be a good balance to know how to ship quickly, but also make strong product and technical decisions that don‚Äôt leave us with dead ends. True to YC advice, our product engineers talk to our customers regularly and ship fast. We also define our own roadmap and often design our own products when needed.\n\nOur stack is pretty straightforward (Rails, React, Postgres), and the last three engineers have learned it on the job. That said, we‚Äôve found that enjoying front-end software development is key to being successful here, so it‚Äôs almost a requirement for the role. Our needs as an organization require a large degree of flexibility, and people change teams quite often.\n\nMore and more, our founders are introducing AI in all they do ‚Äî how they code, how their product works, and how they streamline their own operations. At YC, we‚Äôre similarly pushing the boundaries of how AI can improve our software and help our companies. We‚Äôre excited to share more in person ‚Äî so please take a moment to apply. ;-)\n\nLastly: If you‚Äôre interested in starting your own startup one day: eight former engineers on our team have gone on to start YC-funded startups.¬† If you want to start your own startup someday but aren‚Äôt ready to do it now, working at YC could be an excellent way to get there, provided you‚Äôre willing to be here for at least 2-3 years.\n\nLocation: This is an in-person role at YC's campus in Dogpatch, San Francisco. This is where our users (founders, partners, and employees) are five days a week, so it‚Äôs optimal for you to be here with them. You must live in the SF Bay Area or be willing to relocate.¬† We offer generous relocation support for those who want to move to SF to work here.\n\nCompensation: $180,000 to $270,000 base (depending on skills and experience) plus bonus.\n\nBenefits : YC has a profit-sharing program, which is comparable to equity in an early-stage¬†startup or carry in a VC fund.\n\nOur full benefits package includes medical, vision, and dental plans, infertility benefit, STD/LTD, life insurance, commuter benefits, flexible spending account, health savings account, 401(k) + 4% matching, generous parental leave, paid holidays, and flexible paid time off policy.\n\nWork Authorization: This position does not support work authorization/visa sponsorship.\n\nLegal note: Y Combinator considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state, and local law, including San Francisco‚Äôs Fair Chance Ordinance.

This includes building on top of our Go backend as well as working directly with the Kubernetes and Helm APIs. Since Porter is a PaaS that abstracts the complexity of Kubernetes, deeply considered design/architectural decisions are the lifeblood of our platform. The best implementation is not always the most obvious one, so an appetite for rigorously evaluating the tradeoffs of different options is essential.\n\nYou will be expected to push critical code on a daily basis while also working on larger features that constantly expand the capabilities of the platform.\n\nYOU WILL:\nBuild and maintain new features on the Porter dashboard\nDevelop our Go API to accommodate additional k8s/Helm behaviors\nCreate applets and add-ons for popular technologies like MySQL, Redis, Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.\nImprove the UI and organization of the dashboard (strong UI/UX background is a nice to have)\nRaise the standard for code quality and our engineering culture\nWHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR:\n\nWe value rate of learning above all else. Full stack experience and fluency with React/TypeScript is expected, but less familiarity with Go/Kubernetes is fine if you're a voracious and self-directed learner. Infrastructure management isn't rocket science, but it does involve thinking and working across multiple levels of abstraction at once. If the idea of wrangling that complexity is exciting and not daunting to you, we'd love to talk. As is the case with most early-stage startups, you should be comfortable with regularly shifting priorities and iterating at a very high (daily) velocity.\n\nSOME OF THE TECHNICAL CHALLENGES WE FACE:\nAbstracting Kubernetes - any PaaS spans a variety of use cases, so building a consistent and useful layer of abstraction requires constant awareness of the needs of many user profiles.\nAuto-Generated Frontend - each of our app/add-on templates uses a form.yaml file that programmatically generates a settings UI on the dashboard using a library of our own input primitives. Expanding and testing the functionality of these templates is non-trivial.\nCloud Agnosticism - one of Porter's main benefits is that you get the same interface for managing services regardless of where you host. Our job is to reduce multi-cloud infrastructure complexity to a unified interface.\nMany Integrations - our philosophy is to never reinvent the wheel, so we leverage tools like GitHub Actions, existing container registries, and the APIs of various cloud providers. An issue with any one of these integrations interrupts functionality, so properly handling interactions with numerous services is crucial.\nSAMPLE PROJECTS YOU MIGHT WORK ON:\nBuild a dashboard that gives an infra-level overview of machines being managed by Porter and their current resource utilization\nImplement live email/Slack alerts for successful or failed deployments\nDevelop a deployment pipeline builder that lets users seamlessly promote services across multiple clusters and environments (ex: dev -> staging -> prod)\nCreate one-click deployable applets for popular technologies (e.g. RabbitMQ, Kafka, Cassandra, etc.)\nTECH STACK:\nWeb: React (styled-components), TypeScript\nBackend: Go, Kubernetes + Helm APIs, Postgres, Redis\nInfrastructure: AWS, GCP\n\nPorter is open source. You can view our entire codebase here: https://github.com/porter-dev/porter.\n\nWe are a fully in-person team located in NYC, and we require that you come into the office everyday.\n\nInterested?

We want you to work smart, bring your own perspective, and ask deep questions about what we do and how we do it. You'll play a vital role in how we foster an inspiring culture, and in how we scale the organization in the coming years.\n\nYou love solving problems, right? That's why you're here. Well, we've got excited customers, eagerly awaiting your ideas and implementations. We've got tons of interesting challenges ahead ‚Äì both technical and non-technical ‚Äì and we definitely don't have all the answers yet, but we're striving to ask better questions every day.\n\nDo you relish in the delight of customers, and in the opportunity to develop an amazing product you'll be proud of, and one they'll be happy to pay for? Do you have a keen eye for detail and design, but enjoy trading off perfection in pursuit of progress? Do you thrive in an environment of quick and collaborative iteration?

On the frontend, we have a NextJS application using TypeScript.\n\nWe don't expect you to be an expert in every one of those areas.¬†¬†\n\nIf you've enjoyed working in any functional language, we think you'll love Elixir (but if you've never even dabbled, we think you'll love it too). If you've felt productive working with a framework like Rails or Django, you'll get the hang of Phoenix in no time.\n\nIf you've worked with React, but not TypeScript, we can work with that. If you know your JS, but have never written React, that's fine too. You get the picture ‚Äì it's not about your familiarity with specific technologies. If you're an expert in one or another domain, but open to learning as you go, we'll start from there.\n\nOver time, we'll expect you to wear many hats.
