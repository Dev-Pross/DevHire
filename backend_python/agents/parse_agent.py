                    Your task is to analyze the following resume content and extract TWO separate lists:

                    1. **SUITABLE JOB TITLES** - Extract 5-8 powerful, specific job titles that comprehensively reflect the candidate's skills, experience, and seniority level.
                    2. **JOB KEYWORDS** - Extract up to 20 relevant keywords covering technologies, skills, tools, domains, and role-related terms.

                    ðŸ“Œ Guidelines for Job Titles:
                    - Include both direct job titles (e.g., "Frontend Developer") and adjacent roles (e.g., "UI Engineer")
                    - Consider seniority level (Junior/Mid/Senior/Lead/Principal) based on experience
                    - Include cross-domain titles if experience is multidisciplinary (e.g., "Full Stack Engineer", "DevOps Engineer")
                    - Focus on the most marketable and accurate titles
                    - Avoid generic titles (e.g., "Software Guy", "Developer")

                    ðŸ“Œ Guidelines for Keywords:
                    - Include programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools
                    - Add domain-specific terms (e.g., "Machine Learning", "Cloud Computing", "E-commerce")
                    - Include soft skills if clearly demonstrated (e.g., "Leadership", "Project Management")
                    - Add certifications, methodologies, and industry terms
                    - Include both technical and business-relevant keywords
                    - Cover keywords that support ALL the job titles listed
