This role is fully remote, but we do prefer candidates in US timezones so everyone has some overlapping work hours. As an early employee, you will have immense impact on the product and business.\n\nSOME OF THE PROBLEMS YOU\u2019LL BE WORKING ON\nScaling Event Ingestion. We ingest analytics events from customers (e.g. button clicks, purchases) and make them available for querying with SQL. We need to scale to millions of events per second while keeping latency low (<30s).\nWarehouse Native Product Analytics. We are building an analytics suite (a la Mixpanel or Amplitude) on top of a company\u2019s existing SQL data warehouse. This will require extensive front-end work, data engineering, and performance tuning.\nRealtime Feature Flag Analytics. When a developer pushes code live, they want to know two things right away - \u201cDid I just break anything?\u201d and \u201cIs anyone using my new feature?\u201d. APM tools like DataDog only get you part of the way there and we want to build a truly comprehensive solution.\nRobust SQL Test Suite. We support 12 different SQL data sources, from Postgres to BigQuery to PrestoDB, and each of them have their own quirks and bugs that we need to work around. Supporting this at scale will require building robust automated test suites and provisioning complex cloud infrastructure on demand.\nStreaming Features Service. When someone toggles a feature flag in GrowthBook, we want it to propagate to all of their clients around the world within seconds. And we need to do this reliably (99.999% uptime) and at scale (billions of requests per day).\nREQUIREMENTS\nExpert in Typescript, React, and Node.js\nSolid underst...",
